```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Cálculo del área de un círculo

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
r <- 2
A <- pi*r^2
print(A)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
